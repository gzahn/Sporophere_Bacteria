# Sporophere_Bacteria

Influence of AMF spore traits on associated bacteria



1. Match up ./data/SeqCoast_Manifest.xlsx with sample metadata from Bala's Google Drive for this project
2. Build single complete metadata sheet
3. Run all samples through dada2 pipeline (use silva taxonomy?)
4. Remove contaminants (identified using negative controls)

5. background soil *should* resemble the spore surface bacteria for each AMF taxon
6.
